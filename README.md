## How my computer and I went from beginners to chess professionals ( Personal Experience :) )

Up until this point, I only have 1 hour of playing chess in total, so It's safe to say that I don't know what I'm doing here. But, I've stumbled across this video of Sebastian Lague making a chess AI.

I really love the concept of Artificial Intelligence and It is a part of my Computer Science formation in University. One question came into my mind, Why don't I take It as an opportunity to learn both ?
Now, I'm taking this challenge to learn AI and Chess at the same time.

## What am I waiting from this project ?

My main goal for this project : 
* Learn the basic concepts of Chess and actually know what I am doing
* Learn what exactly is AI and how does It work ?
* Learn the TensorFlow framework 
* Create an AI model that can play chess professionally
